# CostlyMutualism
Scripts and data associated with mesocosm experiment 2018 summer at the University of Oklahoma Biological Station.

Started as a way to assess whether prey subsidies from adult mussels mitigated the cost of larval infection on host fish.
Fish passed from too much stress. So to not have stressed mussels with no scientific benefit, we induced a die-off event in some of the mesocosms with mussels to investigate how mussel die-offs impact ecosystem structure and function. 

Scripts:
Producers.R has code to format and analyze ecosystem metabolism, chlorophyll abundances, ash free dry mass. 

FishData.R has code to address fish weight, length, and survival.

invertebrates.R has code to evalutate macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, and community composition.

physiochem.R has code from hobo temperature loggers and physical-chemical parameters collected during the experiment.

MusselLost.R describes the community with the tanks, mussel soft tissue decay, and mussel biomass estimation.

waterchem.R analyzes absorbance values of water column samples for Ammonium and SRP throughout the experiment.
