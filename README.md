# CostlyMutualism
Scripts and data associated with mesocosm experiment 2018 summer at the University of Oklahoma Biological Station.

Started as a way to assess whether prey subsidies from adult mussels mitigated the cost of larval infection on host fish.
Fish passed from too much stress. So to not have stressed mussels with no scientific benefit, we induced a die-off event in some of the mesocosms with mussels to investigate how mussel die-offs impact ecosystem structure and function. 

### Scripts:
* 1-physiochem.R has code from hobo temperature loggers and physical-chemical parameters collected during the experiment. It also contians physchem, which was a key organizing data frame.

* 2-Producers.R has code to format and analyze ecosystem metabolism, chlorophyll abundances, ash free dry mass. 

* 3-waterchem.R analyzes absorbance values of water column samples for Ammonium and SRP throughout the experiment. 

* 4-invertebrates.R has code to evalutate macroinvertebrate abundance, biomass, and community composition.

* 5a-MusselLost.R describes the community with the tanks, mussel soft tissue decay, and mussel biomass estimation.

* 5b-FishData.R has code to address fish weight, length, and survival. It also includes analysis of invertebrate samples from this time too. Might need to source invertebrates.R or atleast run the start of the code.

* MapMassMort.R has code for Figure 2 in the FEE paper. Its a map of SE Oklahoma and the Flint River.
